## ConflictBot: Your PR Conflict Detector

ConflictBot is a GitHub Action designed to help maintain a smooth and efficient code integration process within your repository. Whenever a new pull request is opened, ConflictBot jumps into action to check if the lines of files changed in the new pull request correspond with lines changed in other open pull requests. If a conflict is detected, the bot helps foster collaboration by creating a comment on the pull request, referencing the conflicting lines, authors, and PR numbers, and suggesting the authors to review each other's changes.

### Getting Started

#### Pre-requisites

A GitHub repository where you intend to use ConflictBot.

Necessary permissions to add a GitHub Action to the repository.

A fine-grained GitHub access token with the following permissions:

- Actions (read-only)
- Commit statuses (read-only)
- Contents (read-only)
- Metadata (read-only)
- Pull Requests (read and write)

#### Setting Up

Create a Personal Access Token: Generate a personal access token with the necessary permissions to enable ConflictBot to interact with your repository.

Save the access token in your Actions Repository Secrets under the name `CONFLICT_BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

Add the Action to Your Repository: Create a new workflow file (.yml) in the .github/workflows directory of your repository and add the configuration for ConflictBot.

##### Here is a basic setup for your GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
name: PR Conflict Checker

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  check_pr_conflicts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run PR Conflict Checker
        uses: depandabot/conflict-bot@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.CONFLICT_BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          main-branch: main
          quiet: true
```

### Contributing

ConflictBot is open-source and we welcome contributions. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make your changes, then open a pull request against the main branch.

We hope ConflictBot helps maintain a smooth and efficient code integration process in your repository. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to open an issue in the repository.

Happy Coding!
